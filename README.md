Extraction

I used 3 datasets from Kaggle and Data World. All of our data was based on county through all the States ranging over various years from 2010 to 2015. 

• Diversity Index from Kaggle. • Unemployment from Kaggle. • Median Income by county from Data World.

Transformation

My first steps in cleaning up the datasets involved figuring out which variables were not relevant.

Load

The last step was to transfer our final output into a Database. I created a database and respective tables to match the columns from the final Panda’s Data Frame using MYSQL and then connected to the database using SQLAlchemy and loaded the result.
